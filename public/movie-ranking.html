<h1>Best Movies According to Chirag</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time that you should watch.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Intersellar</h3>
<p>I love this movie because of how detailed and scientifically interesting this is with complex ideas being played around.Most importantly, it tells us the importance of time through time dilation.</p>
<h3>Predestination</h3>
<p>Another complex movie that totally confuses you but when you realise the actuality of what's happening, it absolutely blows your mind.</p>
<h3>Avengers:Endgame</h3>
<p>This was an end to a saga which everybody was waiting for and it did not fail to deliver. <br />It had action, suspense and a nice finish which everybody had wished for.</p>
